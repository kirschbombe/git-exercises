It's important to remember that
we must use the commit number that identifies the state of the repository
*before* the change we're trying to undo.
A common mistake is to use the number of
the commit in which we made the change we're trying to get rid of.
In the example below, we want to retrieve the state from before the most
recent commit (`HEAD~1`), which is commit `f22b25e`:

So, to put it all together,
here's how Git works in cartoon form:

> ## Recovering Older Versions of a File
>
> Jennifer has made changes to the Python script that she has been working on for weeks, and the
> modifications she made this morning "broke" the script and it no longer runs. She has spent
> ~ 1hr trying to fix it, with no luck...
>
> Luckily, she has been keeping track of her project's versions using Git! Which commands below will
> let her recover the last committed version of her Python script called
> `data_cruncher.py`?
>
> 1. `$ git checkout HEAD`
>
> 2. `$ git checkout HEAD data_cruncher.py`
>
> 3. `$ git checkout HEAD~1 data_cruncher.py`
>
> 4. `$ git checkout <unique ID of last commit> data_cruncher.py`
>
> 5. Both 2 and 4

> ## Reverting a Commit
>
> Jennifer is collaborating on her Python script with her colleagues and
> realizes her last commit to the group repository is wrong and wants to
> undo it.  Jennifer needs to undo correctly so everyone in the group
> repository gets the correct change.  `git revert [wrong commit ID]`
> will make a new commit that undoes Jennifer's previous wrong
> commit. Therefore `git revert` is different than `git checkout [commit
> ID]` because `checkout` is for local changes not committed to the
> group repository.  Below are the right steps and explanations for
> Jennifer to use `git revert`, what is the missing command?
>
> 1. ________ # Look at the git history of the project to find the commit ID
>
> 2. Copy the ID (the first few characters of the ID, e.g. 0b1d055).
>
> 3. `git revert [commit ID]`
>
> 4. Type in the new commit message.
>
> 5. Save and close

> ## Getting Rid of Staged Changes
>
> `git checkout` can be used to restore a previous commit when unstaged changes have
> been made, but will it also work for changes that have been staged but not committed?
> Make a change to `mars.txt`, add that change, and use `git checkout` to see if
> you can remove your change.
