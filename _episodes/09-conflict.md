> ## A Typical Work Session
>
> You sit down at your computer to work on a shared project that is tracked in a
> remote Git repository. During your work session, you take the following
> actions, but not in this order:
>
> - *Make changes* by appending the number `100` to a text file `numbers.txt`
> - *Update remote* repository to match the local repository
> - *Celebrate* your success with beer(s)
> - *Update local* repository to match the remote repository
> - *Stage changes* to be committed
> - *Commit changes* to the local repository
>
> In what order should you perform these actions to minimize the chances of
> conflicts? Put the commands above in order in the *action* column of the table
> below. When you have the order right, see if you can write the corresponding
> commands in the *command* column. A few steps are populated to get you
> started.
