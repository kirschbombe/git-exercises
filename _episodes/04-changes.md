- "How do I check the status of my version control repository?"
- "How do I record notes about what changes I made and why?"

To recap, when we want to add changes to our repository,
we first need to add the changed files to the staging area
(`git add`) and then commit the staged changes to the
repository (`git commit`):

![The Git Commit Workflow](../fig/git-committing.svg)

> ## Choosing a Commit Message
>
> Which of the following commit messages would be most appropriate for the
> last commit made to `mars.txt`?
>
> 1. "Changes"
> 2. "Added line 'But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity' to mars.txt"
> 3. "Discuss effects of Mars' climate on the Mummy"
>
> > ## Solution
> > Answer 1 is not descriptive enough,
> > and answer 2 is too descriptive and redundant,
> > but answer 3 is good: short but descriptive.
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

> ## Committing Changes to Git
>
> Which command(s) below would save the changes of `myfile.txt`
> to my local Git repository?
>
> 1. `$ git commit -m "my recent changes"`
>
> 2. `$ git init myfile.txt`
>    `$ git commit -m "my recent changes"`
>
> 3. `$ git add myfile.txt`
>    `$ git commit -m "my recent changes"`
>
> 4. `$ git commit -m myfile.txt "my recent changes"`
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > 1. Would only create a commit if files have already been staged.
> > 2. Would try to create a new repository.
> > 3. Is correct: first add the file to the staging area, then commit.
> > 4. Would try to commit a file "my recent changes" with the message myfile.txt.

> ## Committing Multiple Files
>
> The staging area can hold changes from any number of files
> that you want to commit as a single snapshot.
>
> 1. Add some text to `mars.txt` noting your decision
> to consider Venus as a base
> 2. Create a new file `venus.txt` with your initial thoughts
> about Venus as a base for you and your friends
> 3. Add changes from both files to the staging area,
> and commit those changes.
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > First we make our changes to the `mars.txt` and `venus.txt` files:
> > ~~~
> > $ nano mars.txt
> > $ cat mars.txt
> > ~~~
> > {: .bash}
> > ~~~
> > Maybe I should start with a base on Venus.
> > ~~~
> > {: .output}
> > ~~~
> > $ nano venus.txt
> > $ cat venus.txt
> > ~~~
> > {: .bash}
> > ~~~
> > Venus is a nice planet and I definitely should consider it as a base.
> > ~~~
> > {: .output}
> > Now you can add both files to the staging area. We can do that in one line:
> >
> > ~~~
> > $ git add mars.txt venus.txt
> > ~~~
> > {: .bash}
> > Or with multiple commands:
> > ~~~
> > $ git add mars.txt
> > $ git add venus.txt
> > ~~~
> > {: .bash}
> > Now the files are ready to commit. You can check that using `git status`. If you are ready to commit use:
> > ~~~
> > $ git commit -m "Write plans to start a base on Venus"
> > ~~~
> > {: .bash}
> > ~~~
> > [master cc127c2]
> >  Write plans to start a base on Venus
> >  2 files changed, 2 insertions(+)
> >  create mode 100644 venus.txt
> > ~~~
> > {: .output}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

> ## Author and Committer
>
> For each of the commits you have done, Git stored your name twice.
> You are named as the author and as the committer. You can observe
> that by telling Git to show you more information about your last
> commits:
>
> ~~~
> $ git log --format=full
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
>
> When commiting you can name someone else as the author:
>
> ~~~
> $ git commit --author="Vlad Dracula <vlad@tran.sylvan.ia>"
> ~~~
> {: .bash}
>
> Create a new repository and create two commits: one without the
> `--author` option and one by naming a colleague of yours as the
> author. Run `git log` and `git log --format=full`. Think about ways
> how that can allow you to collaborate with your colleagues.
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > ~~~
> > $ git add me.txt
> > $ git commit -m "Update Vlad's bio." --author="Frank N. Stein <franky@monster.com>"
> > ~~~
> > {: .bash}
> > ~~~
> > [master 4162a51] Update Vlad's bio.
> > Author: Frank N. Stein <franky@monster.com>
> > 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
> >
> > $ git log --format=full
> > commit 4162a51b273ba799a9d395dd70c45d96dba4e2ff
> > Author: Frank N. Stein <franky@monster.com>
> > Commit: Vlad Dracula <vlad@tran.sylvan.ia>
> >
> > Update Vlad's bio.
> >
> > commit aaa3271e5e26f75f11892718e83a3e2743fab8ea
> > Author: Vlad Dracula <vlad@tran.sylvan.ia>
> > Commit: Vlad Dracula <vlad@tran.sylvan.ia>
> >
> > Vlad's initial bio.
> > ~~~
